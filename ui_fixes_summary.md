# DevPulse UI Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dashboard Icons Size Issue
- **Problem**: Icons in the dashboard were displaying at page width
- **Solution**: 
  - Added proper size constraints to SVG elements in the global CSS
  - Added a specific `dashboard-card-icon` class to control icon sizing
  - Updated the DashboardCard component to use the new class

### 2. Burnout Data API Issues
- **Problem**: API errors when fetching burnout data due to missing repositoryId parameter
- **Solution**:
  - Updated the burnout page to include the required repositoryId parameter
  - Created a mock version of the burnout API route for dry run testing
  - Added proper error handling for the API request

### 3. Permissions API Issues
- **Problem**: Errors fetching permissions data
- **Solution**:
  - Created a mock version of the permissions API route for dry run testing
  - Implemented default permissions based on user roles

### 4. Dry Run Testing Setup
- **Problem**: Need a streamlined way to prepare for dry run testing
- **Solution**:
  - Created a prepare-dry-run.js script to set up the environment
  - Added npm scripts for dry run preparation and execution
  - Created a comprehensive testing document with user flows

## How to Run the Dry Run

## Additional Notes
