# Testing the UI/UX Improvements

This document provides instructions for testing the UI/UX improvements implemented in task 4.1.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm 7 or higher
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Testing the Desktop UI Improvements

### Option 1: Using the Test Script

We've created a script that automates the process of testing the desktop UI improvements. This script will:

1. Backup the current dashboard page
2. Replace it with the updated version
3. Install required dependencies
4. Run the application in development mode

To run the test script:

```bash
npm run test:ui
```

To restore the original dashboard page after testing:

```bash
npm run test:ui:restore
```

### Option 2: Manual Testing

If you prefer to test manually, follow these steps:

1. Install required dependencies:

```bash
npm install clsx tailwind-merge --save
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000/dev/ui-test
```

This page showcases all the new UI components implemented for desktop optimization.

## What to Test

1. **ResponsiveGrid Component**
   - Verify that the grid displays correctly on different screen sizes
   - Test that grid items can span multiple columns

2. **DashboardCard Component**
   - Test different card states: normal, loading, error
   - Test collapsible functionality
   - Verify that cards display title, subtitle, icon, actions, and footer correctly

3. **MultiColumnLayout Component**
   - Test collapsing and expanding the sidebar and right panel
   - Verify that the layout adapts to different screen sizes
   - Test that the layout stacks vertically on mobile screens

4. **KeyboardShortcutsDialog Component**
   - Press ? to open the keyboard shortcuts dialog
   - Verify that all shortcuts are displayed correctly
   - Test closing the dialog with the Escape key

5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Test the global shortcuts (?, Ctrl+G, Ctrl+H)
   - Test page-specific shortcuts (Ctrl+L, Ctrl+E, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+K)
   - Verify that shortcuts are disabled when typing in input fields

## Test on Different Screen Sizes

Use your browser's developer tools to test the UI on different screen sizes:

1. Open developer tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. Click on the device toggle button (or press Ctrl+Shift+M)
3. Select different device presets or set custom dimensions
4. Verify that the UI adapts correctly to each screen size

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues during testing, please document them with:

1. A description of the issue
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Expected behavior
4. Actual behavior
5. Screenshots (if applicable)
6. Browser and screen size information
