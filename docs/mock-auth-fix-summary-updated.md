# Mock Authentication Fix Summary (Updated)

## Issue
Users were being redirected to the "unauthorized page" when using mock mode. The console log showed a 403 Forbidden error when trying to access `/api/users/settings`.

## Root Causes
1. The permission check in the user settings API route wasn't properly handling role aliases (e.g., 'ADMIN' vs 'ADMINISTRATOR')
2. The role comparison in the `usePermissions` hook wasn't robust enough to handle different role formats
3. The mock session middleware wasn't normalizing role names to match the expected format
4. The settings page was making an API call to `/api/users/settings` instead of `/api/users/{userId}/settings`
5. The mock session middleware wasn't providing a mock session for settings routes when no userId was found in the URL

## Fixes Applied

### 1. User Settings API Route
Updated the permission check to accept both 'ADMINISTRATOR' and 'ADMIN' roles:
```typescript
if (!bypassPermissionCheck && session.user.id !== params.userId && session.user.role !== 'ADMINISTRATOR' && session.user.role !== 'ADMIN') {
```

### 2. usePermissions Hook
- Enhanced role mapping to handle more variations and provide a default
- Improved the `hasRole` function to handle role aliases properly with case-insensitive comparison

### 3. Mock Session Middleware
- Updated the mock session creation to normalize role names
- Modified the middleware to always provide a mock session for settings routes, even if there's no userId in the URL:
```typescript
// For settings routes, always provide a mock session
const isSettingsRoute = url.pathname.includes('/settings');

// If we found a user ID in the URL, or it's a settings route, use it for the mock session
if ((userIdIndex > 0 && userIdIndex < pathParts.length) || isSettingsRoute) {
  // Get userId from URL or use default for settings routes
  const userId = (userIdIndex > 0 && userIdIndex < pathParts.length) ? 
    pathParts[userIdIndex] : mockUsers[0].id.toString();
```

### 4. Settings Page
- Added better error handling and logging for when the user ID is missing from the session
- Added more detailed error messages when the API call fails

## Testing
The fix should be tested by:
1. Enabling mock mode
2. Logging in with different mock user roles
3. Verifying that users can access the settings page without being redirected to the unauthorized page
4. Checking that role-based permissions work correctly for different mock users
