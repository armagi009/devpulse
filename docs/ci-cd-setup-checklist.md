## üö® Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Workflow fails with permission errors:**
- Check GitHub Actions permissions in repository settings
- Ensure "Read and write permissions" is selected

**Vercel deployment fails:**
- Verify environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Check build command and output directory settings
- Review build logs for specific errors

**Tests fail in CI but pass locally:**
- Check environment variables in CI
- Verify database setup in CI environment
- Look for timing issues in async tests

**SonarCloud analysis fails:**
- Verify SONAR_TOKEN is correct and not expired
- Check project key matches sonar-project.properties
- Ensure organization permissions are correct

## üìû Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the logs:** Review GitHub Actions workflow logs for specific errors
2. **Consult documentation:** Review `ci-cd-operational-guide.md` for detailed instructions
3. **Run diagnostics:** Use `node scripts/verify-ci-operational.js` to identify issues
4. **Check external services:** Verify Vercel, SonarCloud, and other service dashboards
5. **Create an issue:** Use GitHub issue templates to report problems

## üéâ Completion

Once all items are checked off:

- [ ] **Final verification:** Run `node scripts/verify-ci-operational.js` one more time
- [ ] **Document any customizations:** Update documentation with any project-specific changes
- [ ] **Train the team:** Ensure all team members understand the workflow
- [ ] **Celebrate:** Your CI/CD pipeline is now fully operational! üöÄ
