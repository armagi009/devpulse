# CI/CD Temporary Disables

## Overview
This document tracks temporarily disabled CI/CD features that need to be re-enabled after external services are configured.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **ALL WORKFLOWS COMPLETELY DISABLED**

**Status**: All GitHub Actions workflows are currently disabled to prevent any automatic runs.

- ‚ùå All workflow triggers (push, PR, schedule) are commented out
- ‚ùå All cron jobs are disabled (no scheduled runs)
- ‚úÖ Only manual `workflow_dispatch` triggers remain active
- **No workflows will run automatically** until re-enabled

### Disabled Cron Jobs:
- `code-quality.yml`: Weekly runs (Sundays 2 AM UTC) - **DISABLED**
- `dependency-updates.yml`: Weekly runs (Mondays 9 AM UTC) - **DISABLED** 
- `monitoring.yml`: Every 15 minutes health checks - **DISABLED**

## Currently Disabled Features

### 1. Accessibility Audit Job
- **File**: `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`
- **Reason**: Requires database and external services setup
- **Dependencies**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Playwright E2E tests
- **Re-enable after**: External services configuration is complete

### 2. SonarCloud Analysis
- **File**: `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`
- **Reason**: Requires SONAR_TOKEN secret configuration
- **Dependencies**: SonarCloud account and token setup
- **Re-enable after**: SonarCloud integration is configured

### 3. Bundle Analysis
- **File**: `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`
- **Reason**: May require specific workflow configuration
- **Dependencies**: Bundle analysis action setup
- **Re-enable after**: Bundle analysis is properly configured

## Currently Active Features

üö´ **ALL WORKFLOWS DISABLED** - No automatic triggers active
üîß **Manual Triggers Only** - Can be run manually via GitHub UI if needed

## Re-enabling Process

When external services are ready:

1. **Re-enable All Workflow Triggers**:
   ```bash
   # In ALL .github/workflows/*.yml files:
   # Uncomment the "on:" sections with push, pull_request, schedule triggers
   # Remove the "# TEMPORARILY DISABLED" comments
   ```

2. **Re-enable Specific Features**:
   - **Accessibility Audit**: Uncomment job in code-quality.yml
   - **SonarCloud**: Add SONAR_TOKEN secret and uncomment scan step
   - **Bundle Analysis**: Uncomment bundle analysis step
   - **Monitoring**: Uncomment cron schedule for health checks

3. **External Service Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure these are configured first:
   # - Vercel deployment tokens
   # - Database connections
   # - SonarCloud integration
   # - Lighthouse CI tokens
   ```

## Current Workflow Status

The workflow now focuses on:
- ‚úÖ Code security scanning (CodeQL)
- ‚úÖ Unit test execution
- ‚úÖ Build verification
- ‚úÖ Basic code quality checks

This provides essential CI/CD functionality while avoiding external service dependencies.
