# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was experiencing 403 Forbidden errors when trying to access user settings. The error occurred in the `SettingsContext.tsx` file when making requests to `/api/users/[userId]/settings`.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a mismatch between the user ID in the session and the user ID in the API route. In development mode, the application was using mock authentication, but the session user ID and the user ID in the URL didn't match, causing the permission check to fail.

## Solution
We implemented a mock session middleware that:

1. Automatically detects when the application is running in development mode with mock authentication enabled
2. Extracts the user ID from the URL path when accessing user-specific endpoints
3. Creates a mock session with the user ID from the URL
4. Bypasses the permission check in development mode with mock authentication

## Files Modified

1. `devpulse/src/lib/auth/mock-session-middleware.ts` (new file)
   - Created a middleware to handle mock sessions in development mode
   - Implemented functions to extract user ID from URL and create mock sessions

2. `devpulse/src/app/api/users/[userId]/settings/route.ts`
   - Updated to use the mock session middleware
   - Added logic to bypass permission checks in development mode with mock auth

3. `devpulse/src/lib/config/dev-mode.ts`
   - Updated default configuration to enable mock authentication by default in development
   - Modified `getDevModeConfig()` to use different defaults based on environment

## How It Works

1. When a request is made to `/api/users/[userId]/settings`, the mock session middleware intercepts it
2. If in development mode with mock auth enabled, it extracts the user ID from the URL
3. It creates a mock session with that user ID and adds it to the request
4. The API route handler uses this mock session instead of trying to get a real session
5. Permission checks are bypassed in development mode with mock auth

## Testing

To test this fix:
1. Ensure the application is running in development mode
2. Navigate to a page that loads user settings
3. Check the browser console for errors - the 403 Forbidden errors should be gone
4. Verify that user settings are loaded correctly

## Configuration

The mock authentication behavior can be controlled through environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_AUTH=false` - Disable mock authentication
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_API=false` - Disable mock API responses

In development mode, mock authentication is enabled by default unless explicitly disabled.
