# 🎉 ES Module Issue FIXED!

## Problem Solved ✅

Your DevPulse application build was failing with:
```
⨯ Failed to load next.config.js
ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope, you can use import instead
```

## Root Cause 🔍

The issue was caused by having `"type": "module"` in `package.json`, which made Node.js treat all `.js` files as ES modules. However:

1. **Next.js Configuration**: `next.config.js` was using CommonJS syntax (`require`, `module.exports`)
2. **Script Files**: Many scripts in the `/scripts` directory were using CommonJS syntax
3. **Mixed Module Systems**: This created a conflict between ES modules and CommonJS

## Solution Applied ✅

### **1. Removed `"type": "module"` from package.json**
- **Before**: `"type": "module"` was forcing all `.js` files to be treated as ES modules
- **After**: Removed this line, allowing Next.js to use its default CommonJS configuration

### **2. Kept next.config.js in CommonJS format**
- **Syntax**: Uses `const path = require('path')` and `module.exports = nextConfig`
- **Compatibility**: Works perfectly with Next.js default configuration
- **No Changes Needed**: All existing scripts remain compatible
