# DevPulse Requirements Document

## Introduction

DevPulse is an AI-native development analytics platform that transforms GitHub data into actionable insights for developers and teams. The flagship feature is "Burnout Radar" - an AI system that predicts and prevents developer burnout through behavioral pattern analysis. The platform serves developers seeking to understand their productivity patterns, teams optimizing collaboration, and managers needing early warning systems to support their teams.

The platform includes a schema adapter layer for handling database schema differences, a mock authentication and data system for development and testing, and comprehensive UI/UX improvements for a consistent user experience.
