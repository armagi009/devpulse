# DevPulse Requirements Document

## Introduction

DevPulse is an AI-native development analytics platform that transforms GitHub data into actionable insights for developers and teams. The flagship feature is "Burnout Radar" - an AI system that predicts and prevents developer burnout through behavioral pattern analysis. The platform serves developers seeking to understand their productivity patterns, teams optimizing collaboration, and managers needing early warning systems to support their teams.

5. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate their session and clear stored tokens

### Requirement 2: Repository Data Collection and Synchronization

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first authenticates THEN the system SHALL fetch all accessible repositories
2. WHEN initial sync occurs THEN the system SHALL collect last 30 days of commits, PRs, and issues
3. WHEN daily sync runs THEN the system SHALL fetch incremental updates since last sync
4. IF GitHub API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff
5. WHEN sync operations fail THEN the system SHALL retry with graceful degradation
6. WHEN large repositories are synced THEN the system SHALL process data in background jobs
7. IF sync takes longer than 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators to users

### Requirement 3: Burnout Risk Prediction and Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see my burnout risk score based on my coding patterns, so that I can take preventive action before experiencing burnout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sufficient data is available THEN the system SHALL calculate burnout risk score (0-100 scale)
2. WHEN calculating risk THEN the system SHALL analyze work hours patterns, code quality trends, collaboration levels, workload distribution, resolution times, and weekend work frequency
3. WHEN risk score is calculated THEN the system SHALL provide confidence level and key contributing factors
4. IF AI services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to statistical analysis methods
5. WHEN risk score exceeds 70 THEN the system SHALL generate intervention recommendations
6. WHEN displaying risk THEN the system SHALL show historical trends and pattern changes

### Requirement 4: Personal Productivity Analytics Dashboard

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to visualize my productivity patterns and coding habits, so that I can understand my work patterns and optimize my performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user accesses dashboard THEN the system SHALL display daily/weekly commit patterns
2. WHEN showing productivity THEN the system SHALL include lines of code, commit frequency, and work hour distribution
3. WHEN displaying metrics THEN the system SHALL show interactive charts with hover tooltips
4. IF data is loading THEN the system SHALL show skeleton loading states
5. WHEN charts render THEN the system SHALL complete rendering within 2 seconds
6. WHEN user interacts with charts THEN the system SHALL provide drill-down capabilities

### Requirement 5: Team Collaboration Analytics

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to see team collaboration patterns and velocity metrics, so that I can optimize team performance and identify potential issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing team view THEN the system SHALL display team velocity trends
2. WHEN showing collaboration THEN the system SHALL visualize team interaction networks
3. WHEN analyzing PRs THEN the system SHALL show review cycle efficiency metrics
4. WHEN displaying team health THEN the system SHALL identify knowledge silos and collaboration gaps
5. IF team has insufficient data THEN the system SHALL show appropriate messaging
6. WHEN team metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL update in real-time

### Requirement 6: AI-Powered Auto-Retrospectives

**User Story:** As a team member, I want automatically generated retrospectives based on our development data, so that we can identify improvements without manual analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retrospective is requested THEN the system SHALL analyze team data for specified period
2. WHEN generating retrospective THEN the system SHALL identify what went well, areas for improvement, and action items
3. WHEN AI analysis completes THEN the system SHALL format results in structured sections
4. IF OpenAI API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL generate basic statistical retrospective
5. WHEN retrospective is generated THEN the system SHALL allow export to common formats
6. WHEN displaying retrospective THEN the system SHALL highlight key insights and trends

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and respond promptly, so that I can efficiently access my development insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user loads any page THEN the system SHALL complete initial render within 2 seconds
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL respond within 500ms
3. WHEN database queries execute THEN the system SHALL use proper indexing for performance
4. WHEN GitHub API calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement caching strategies
5. IF system experiences high load THEN the system SHALL maintain performance through optimization
6. WHEN background jobs run THEN the system SHALL not impact user-facing performance

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and continue functioning, so that temporary issues don't prevent me from accessing my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub API errors occur THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN AI services fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to statistical analysis
3. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL show appropriate user messaging
4. IF sync operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and retry automatically
5. WHEN critical errors happen THEN the system SHALL maintain core functionality
6. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL automatically resume normal operation

### Requirement 9: Data Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my GitHub data to be handled securely and privately, so that I can trust the platform with my development information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information
2. WHEN accessing GitHub APIs THEN the system SHALL use secure token storage
3. WHEN user data is processed THEN the system SHALL follow data privacy best practices
4. IF user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL remove all associated data
5. WHEN displaying data THEN the system SHALL only show data the user has access to
6. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL use secure session management

### Requirement 10: Mobile and Responsive Design
