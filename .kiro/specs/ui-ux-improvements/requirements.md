# UI/UX Improvements Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DevPulse application requires significant UI/UX improvements to ensure a consistent, intuitive, and effective user experience across all features. This spec focuses on defining user roles, user flows, navigation patterns, and interaction models to create a cohesive experience that supports both live and mock/demo modes. The improvements will address current inconsistencies, enhance accessibility, and optimize the application for various devices and screen sizes.
