# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a comprehensive testing system to identify and fix runtime errors, 404 errors, and rendering issues in the DevPulse application when running in mock mode. The goal is to systematically test all possible user flows across all three defined roles (developer, team-lead, manager) to uncover and catalog all issues for systematic resolution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want to systematically test all application flows in mock mode, so that I can identify all runtime errors, 404 errors, and rendering issues before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the comprehensive test suite is executed THEN the system SHALL test all navigation paths for each of the three primary roles (developer, team-lead, manager)
2. WHEN testing each role THEN the system SHALL click on every sidebar navigation item and verify successful page loading
3. WHEN testing dashboard pages THEN the system SHALL interact with every interactive element (buttons, dropdowns, filters, charts) and verify proper functionality
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL capture the error details including error type, stack trace, URL, user role, and reproduction steps
5. WHEN testing is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive error report with categorized issues and priority levels

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated error detection and logging during comprehensive testing, so that I can efficiently identify and prioritize issues for resolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL automatically detect JavaScript runtime errors, network errors, and console errors
2. WHEN a 404 error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the requested URL, referring page, and user context
3. WHEN a rendering error occurs THEN the system SHALL capture screenshots and DOM state for debugging
4. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
5. WHEN testing completes THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error reports with suggested fixes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want role-specific testing coverage, so that I can ensure each user type has a fully functional experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing developer role THEN the system SHALL test all developer-specific features including personal analytics, code metrics, and individual productivity views
2. WHEN testing team-lead role THEN the system SHALL test all team management features including member management, team analytics, and retrospective tools
3. WHEN testing manager role THEN the system SHALL test all administrative features including system settings, user management, and organizational analytics
4. WHEN testing each role THEN the system SHALL verify proper permission enforcement and role-based UI rendering
5. WHEN role testing completes THEN the system SHALL provide role-specific error summaries and functionality coverage reports

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive interaction testing, so that I can ensure all UI components function correctly under various user interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL test form submissions, button clicks, dropdown selections, and modal interactions
2. WHEN testing data visualization THEN the system SHALL interact with charts, filters, time range selectors, and data export features
3. WHEN testing navigation THEN the system SHALL test breadcrumb navigation, back/forward buttons, and deep linking
4. WHEN testing responsive behavior THEN the system SHALL test mobile and desktop layouts for all pages
5. WHEN testing accessibility THEN the system SHALL verify keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want systematic error reproduction and documentation, so that developers can efficiently fix identified issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error is detected THEN the system SHALL record the exact steps to reproduce the issue
2. WHEN documenting errors THEN the system SHALL include browser information, screen resolution, and mock user context
3. WHEN errors are cataloged THEN the system SHALL group similar errors and identify patterns
4. WHEN providing fix suggestions THEN the system SHALL analyze error types and recommend specific remediation approaches
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL prioritize errors by user impact and frequency of occurrence

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want deep component and interaction testing, so that runtime errors, component failures, and integration issues are caught before reaching users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL click every button, link, and interactive component to verify functionality
2. WHEN testing component rendering THEN the system SHALL verify components display actual content rather than placeholder text or loading states
3. WHEN testing navigation THEN the system SHALL verify all links lead to valid destinations without 404 errors
4. WHEN testing API integration THEN the system SHALL verify components properly handle API responses, loading states, and error conditions
5. WHEN testing component imports THEN the system SHALL detect JavaScript runtime errors caused by missing or incorrectly imported components
