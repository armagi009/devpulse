# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Mock Authentication and Test Data feature will provide a way to test and develop DevPulse without requiring real GitHub credentials. This will allow developers to work on the application's core functionality in isolation, making development and testing more efficient. The feature will include a mock authentication system that simulates GitHub OAuth and a set of realistic test data that mimics GitHub repositories, commits, pull requests, and other relevant data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Mock Authentication System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to bypass the GitHub OAuth flow during development, so that I can test the application without real GitHub credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide an option to use mock authentication
2. WHEN a user selects mock authentication THEN the system SHALL create a mock user session without requiring GitHub credentials
3. WHEN mock authentication is enabled THEN the system SHALL simulate the same authentication flow as the real GitHub OAuth
4. WHEN a user is authenticated with mock authentication THEN the system SHALL provide the same user session data structure as with real authentication
5. WHEN mock authentication is enabled THEN the system SHALL allow switching between different mock user profiles

### Requirement 2: Mock GitHub API Responses

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to use mock GitHub API responses, so that I can test GitHub-dependent features without hitting rate limits or requiring real repositories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mock authentication is enabled THEN the system SHALL intercept GitHub API calls and return mock responses
2. WHEN the GitHub API client requests repository data THEN the system SHALL return realistic mock repository data
3. WHEN the GitHub API client requests commit history THEN the system SHALL return mock commit data with realistic patterns
4. WHEN the GitHub API client requests pull request data THEN the system SHALL return mock pull request data
5. WHEN the GitHub API client requests issue data THEN the system SHALL return mock issue data
6. WHEN using mock API responses THEN the system SHALL simulate API rate limits and errors to test error handling

### Requirement 3: Realistic Test Data Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the mock data to be realistic and configurable, so that I can test different scenarios and edge cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating mock data THEN the system SHALL create data that mimics real GitHub data patterns
2. WHEN generating mock data THEN the system SHALL include various patterns of activity (e.g., high activity, low activity, irregular patterns)
3. WHEN generating mock data THEN the system SHALL create data that can trigger different burnout risk levels
4. WHEN generating mock data THEN the system SHALL create data that demonstrates different team collaboration patterns
5. WHEN generating mock data THEN the system SHALL allow configuring the time range of the data
6. WHEN generating mock data THEN the system SHALL allow configuring the number of repositories, users, and activity volume

### Requirement 4: Development Mode Toggle

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily toggle between mock and real authentication/data, so that I can switch between development and production modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL check environment variables to determine whether to use mock or real authentication
2. WHEN the environment variable is set to use mock mode THEN the system SHALL use mock authentication and data
3. WHEN the environment variable is set to use real mode THEN the system SHALL use real GitHub OAuth and API
4. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide a UI indicator showing that mock mode is active
5. WHEN in mock mode THEN the system SHALL log mock API calls for debugging purposes

### Requirement 5: Mock Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a developer, I want mock data to be persistent between application restarts, so that I can have a consistent testing environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mock data is generated THEN the system SHALL store it in a local database
2. WHEN the application restarts THEN the system SHALL load the previously generated mock data
3. WHEN using mock mode THEN the system SHALL provide an option to reset mock data to its initial state
4. WHEN mock data is reset THEN the system SHALL regenerate all mock data from scratch
5. WHEN using mock mode THEN the system SHALL allow exporting and importing mock data sets

### Requirement 6: Documentation and Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation on how to use the mock authentication and test data, so that I can quickly set up my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer sets up the project THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation on how to enable mock mode
2. WHEN mock mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide documentation on available mock users and their characteristics
3. WHEN using mock mode THEN the system SHALL provide documentation on the structure and patterns of the mock data
4. WHEN using mock mode THEN the system SHALL provide a developer dashboard for inspecting and manipulating mock data
