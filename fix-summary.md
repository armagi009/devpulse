# CollaborationNetworkChart.tsx Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. Added missing `useMemo` import:
   ```typescript
   import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState, useMemo } from 'react';
   ```

2. Removed duplicate declarations of `isLargeNetwork` variable:
   - Kept the first declaration at line ~70
   - Removed the second declaration at line ~100
   - Removed the third declaration at line ~156

## Explanation

The error occurred because the variable `isLargeNetwork` was defined multiple times within the same scope. In JavaScript/TypeScript, you cannot declare the same variable multiple times in the same scope using `const`, `let`, or `var`.

The fix maintains the first declaration of `isLargeNetwork` and removes the subsequent declarations, allowing the variable to be used throughout the component without redefinition.

## Testing

To verify the fix, you should:

1. Run the build process to ensure no compilation errors
2. Test the CollaborationNetworkChart component to ensure it renders correctly
3. Verify that the network visualization still works with both small and large networks

## Additional Notes

- The component uses the `isLargeNetwork` flag to optimize rendering for different network sizes
- The optimization includes adjusting node sizes, label visibility, and simulation parameters
- These optimizations are important for performance, especially with larger networks
