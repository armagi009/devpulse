# Permission System Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The authentication system was redirecting users to the unauthorized page despite successful login. After investigation, we found issues in the `usePermissions.ts` hook around line 48.

## Root Cause
1. The code was directly casting a string to the `UserRole` enum without proper validation:
   ```typescript
   const role = session.user.role.toUpperCase();
   // ...
   setUserRole(role as UserRole);
   ```

2. This caused type mismatches when comparing roles in the `hasRole` function, leading to permission checks failing even when the user had the correct role.

3. The cache was also storing the incorrectly cast role value.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Role Assignment
Instead of directly casting the string to the enum, we now properly map it to the correct enum value:

```typescript
// Convert string role to proper UserRole enum value
if (role === 'ADMINISTRATOR' || role === 'ADMIN') {
  setUserRole(UserRole.ADMINISTRATOR);
} else if (role === 'TEAM_LEAD' || role === 'LEAD') {
  setUserRole(UserRole.TEAM_LEAD);
} else {
  setUserRole(UserRole.DEVELOPER);
}
```

### 2. Fixed Cache Update
Updated the cache to store the proper enum value:

```typescript
// Update cache with proper UserRole enum value
let properRole: UserRole;
if (role === 'ADMINISTRATOR' || role === 'ADMIN') {
  properRole = UserRole.ADMINISTRATOR;
} else if (role === 'TEAM_LEAD' || role === 'LEAD') {
  properRole = UserRole.TEAM_LEAD;
} else {
  properRole = UserRole.DEVELOPER;
}

permissionsCache.set(userId, {
  permissions: mockPermissions,
  role: properRole,
  timestamp: now,
});
```

### 3. Improved Role Comparison
Enhanced the `hasRole` function to handle potential type mismatches:

```typescript
const hasRole = useCallback(
  (role: UserRole): boolean => {
    if (!userRole) return false;
    
    // Compare as strings to avoid enum comparison issues
    return userRole.toString() === role.toString();
  },
  [userRole]
);
```

## Expected Results
These changes should fix the unauthorized redirect issue by ensuring:

1. The user's role is properly converted to the correct enum value
2. Role comparisons work correctly regardless of how the role was stored
3. The permissions cache stores consistent role values

Users should now be able to log in and access pages according to their assigned roles without being incorrectly redirected to the unauthorized page.

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Consistent Role Handling**: Ensure all role comparisons throughout the application use the same approach (either comparing enum values directly or converting to strings first).

2. **Debug Logging**: Consider adding more debug logging around role assignments and checks to make troubleshooting easier in the future.

3. **Session Inspection Tool**: Create a debug route or component that displays the current session and permissions to help diagnose similar issues.

4. **Error Recovery**: Enhance the error recovery page to provide more specific guidance when permission issues occur.
